                    AFFORDABLE INTEGRATED STATE OF THE ART HEALTHCARE FROM MEDIAIDE SOLUTIONS
                </h4>
                <p class="font15">
                    Quality healthcare is expensive anywhere in the world. Very few countries have truly universal healthcare and some of those
                    that do donâ€™t offer free healthcare. The citizens still need to pay for their health insurance. For millions
                    of people in developed countries like the United States, Canada and United Kingdom along with a few nations
                    in Europe, advanced healthcare is almost unaffordable. Spending up to $200,000 for bone marrow transplant
                    or around $3,000 for dental implants is beyond reckoning for a significant majority. This compels many
                    to either avoid medical intervention or to look for alternatives.

                <p class="font15">
                    There is no better alternative than fully integrated and affordable yet state of the art healthcare available in India. The
                    thought of having to fly halfway across the world to a country one may not have been to can be quite
                    unnerving. It is not just about the healthcare when it comes to medical tourism. One has to manage the
                    visas, international flights, accommodation, doctor appointments and planning a remedial course at a
                    chosen hospital. The choice of hospital alone can be a daunting challenge as there are plenty of options
                    and one may have limited awareness of the quality of healthcare in India.

                    India is second to none when it comes to state of the art fully integrated healthcare. The fact that there are so many doctors
                    of Indian origin in the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore among other regions in the world
                    is a testimony to their reliability and expertise. The only reason why medical treatments is more affordable
                    in India compared to the US, the UK or Singapore is the currency. Bypass surgery costs $25,000 in the
                    UK and $35,000 in the US. The same costs $6,000 in India. From Lasik surgery to in-vitro fertilization,
                    everything is exponentially more affordable.
