            interpretations for different people. For some the attractions are the varied culture and heritage and for some
            it is the land of religion and a complete spiritual experience.

            INDIA: LAND OF DIVERSE ATTRACTIONS
        </h4>
        <p class="font15">
            India offers an amazing variety of experiences and adventures. From the beautiful Himalayas in the North to the plateaus,
            tropical rain forests, sandy deserts and palm fringed beaches in the South – India provides a staggering number
            of topographical variations. Equally enchanting is the cultural diversity of India, which is the result of the
            coexistence of a number of religions like Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Islam, Sikhism
            and many more. The towering temples in South India which are easily identifiable by their ornately – sculptured
            exteriors and interiors are associated with great many crafts and performing arts of the region. In Western India
            lies the desert of Kutch, where the tough lifestyle is made vibrant by a profusion of jewellery and ornamental
            embroidery. In the north is the Himalayan range which makes the state of Jammu and Kashmir, probably the most
            beautiful place in the world. Then there are the Colourful tribal lifestyles of the north –eastern states of
            Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh.

            PROGRESS IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
        </h4>
        <p class="font15">
            India has made considerable economic progress since its Independence. Most noticeable are the expansion and diversification
            of production both in industry and agriculture. New technologies were introduced in many industries. Industrial
            investment took place in a large variety of new industries. Modern management techniques were introduced. Entirely
            new classes of entrepreneurs have come up with the support system from the Government, and a large number of
            new industrial centers have developed in almost all parts of the country. Over the years, the Government has
            built the infrastructure required by the industry and made massive investments to provide the much-needed facilities
            of power, communications, roads etc. A good number of institutions were promoted to help entrepreneurship development,
            provide finance for industry and to facilitate development of a variety of skills required by the industry as
            well as agriculture. The Government also followed a policy of encouraging indigenous industries and provides
            them all facilities and encouragement. As a result, we now have a widely diversified base of industry and an
            increased domestic production of a wide range of goods and services.
        </p>
        <p class="font15">
            In 1991, India threw open the industrial sector to greater international and domestic competition. Financial systems have
            been strengthened and India is well developed. India in recent years has emerged as one of the leading destinations
            for investors from developed countries.
        </p>
        <p class="font15">
            Supporting infrastructure facilities are also being made available. The country has the largest railway network in Asia and
            the second largest in the world under a single management. Roads are taking developmental changes to the most
            remote corners of the country.
        </p>
        <p class="font15">
            Inter-university centers and consortia for advanced studies were fast becoming active centers of learning. Their success,
            it has been observed, is based on a rare combination: scientific knowledge and the readiness to test and match
            it to folk wisdom. India has stepped into the new millennium with great confidence.
        </p>
        <p class="font15">
            India therefore can be defined as a land where humanity has lived since ages; where different religions, societies, cultures,
            languages have interplayed with each other in harmony; a land which has seen the best and the worst of everything;
            a land where religion means more than their name; a place where nature has bestowed itself in all its colors
            to end it all a land which shall remain itself till eternity.

            INDIA’S GROWTH IN MEDICAL TOURISM
        </h4>
        <p class="font15">
            India is emerging as a preferred spot for medical tourism. The Government of India, State tourism boards, travel agents,
            tour operators, hotel companies and private sector hospitals are exploring the medical tourism industry for tremendous
            opportunities. They are seeking to capitalise on the opportunities by combining the country’s popular leisure
            tourism with medical tourism.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4 class="font19">
            WHY ONLY INDIA?
        </h4>
        <p class="font15">
            The Indian medical tourism industry, growing at an annual rate of 30 percent, caters to patients chiefly from the US, Europe,
            West Asia and Africa. Although in its nascent stage, the industry is outsmarting similar industries of other
            countries such as Greece, South Africa, Jordan, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore. In 2004, 1, 50,000 medical
            tourists have visited India. The medical costs in India are one-tenth of the costs in western countries. For
            instance, a heart surgery costs $6,000 in India as against $30,000 in the US. Similarly, a bone marrow transplant
            costs $26,000 in India as compared to $2, 50,000 in the US.
        </p>
        <p class="font15">
            Foreign patients throng Indian hospitals to pass up the long waiting lists and queues in their native countries. Indian hospitals
            provide immediate attention to patients rather than asking them to wait for several months like in most western
            countries. Further, foreign patients need not tackle insurance and national medical systems in India as they
            have to in their native lands.
        </p>
        <p class="font15">
            India offers the best treatments in modern medicine as well as in traditional methods of treatment such as Ayurveda, Homeopathy,
            Naturopathy and Yoga. India’s private hospitals have gained international recognition for their facilities, diagnostic
            centers and best work force. Their technology and procedures are on par with hospitals in developed nations.
            Foreign patients can get package deals including flights, transfers, hotels, treatment and post-operative vacation
            for their medical visits to India. Many foreign patients prefer to combine their leisure and relaxation visits
            to India with healthcare.
        </p>
        <p class="font15">
            The Government of India has declared that treating of foreign patients is legal. It is encouraging medical tourism in the
            country by offering tax breaks and export incentives to participating hospitals.

        <h4 class="font19">
            THERE IS GROUND FOR FURTHER VAST GROWTH
        </h4>
        <p class="font15">
            The medical tourism industry in India is presently earning revenues of $333 million. Encouraged by the incredible pace of
            growth exhibited by the industry, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and McKinsey have predicted that
            the industry will grow to earn additional revenue of $2.2 billion by 2012. Govt. of India is also supporting
            by quick visa processing, improved flight connectivity and infrastructure development With a view to facilitating
            the medical tourism industry to achieve the targets and to give greater momentum for its growth, the Ministry
            of Health and Family Welfare together with the Ministry of Tourism of the Government of India has set up a Task
            Force. The Task Force evaluates the opportunities in the industry and formulates a policy for accrediting healthcare
            institutions in India. The accreditation programme is aimed at classifying health service providers on the basis
            of infrastructure and quality of services offered. It is expected to standardize procedures and facilitate foreign
            patients in selecting the best hospitals. Meanwhile, several hospitals in the country are seeking to take advantage
            of the booming medical tourism industry. They are investing largely in acquiring equipments, size and skills.
            The hospitals are in a row to acquire international accreditation, improve their standards and integrate their
            services by tying up with tour operators, airline carriers and hotel companies. Hospitals also allow foreign
            patients to pay through credit and ensure proper support services to foreign patients after they return to their
            native countries.
